            <h4>Getting My First Client As a Web Developer</h4>
            <hr />
            <p>
              After developing my first Hello world Programme , I started to
              making websites for practise purpose. I had convinced my brother
              to let me stab at building a better version of his outdated
              ecommerce management system
            </p>
            <p>
              I wasn't perfect. Even I didn't know javascript when started my
              first Client Project(a web application). I started to make web application then tried
              to become perfect.
            </p>

            <p>
              From this you'll see that I'm Someone that jumps before I can talk
              myself out of doing Something scary

            <h3 style="text-align:center;">Story Of a self taught Developer</h3>
            <br>
            `` I had just graduated with possibly one of the least useful degrees out there - 'Surf Science & Technology' - I shit you not, this exists and my 17 year old self thought something along the lines of 'I like to surf, that course sounds pretty rad, dude!'.
            
            It wasn't that 'rad' and to make any use of it you'd have to treat it as a ticket to being accepted to study a more practical MSc. in the field of oceanography.
            
            So I chose to follow this route and moved home to spend some time working to save up for the tuition fees and living expenses.
            
            That was a pretty slow process.<br> I started working in a couple of bars but eventually got a job working in a factory, putting bits of metal on other bits of metal - not fun but the money was a little better than working in bars.
            
            I wanted to speed this up, even if I could do something outside of work to make another ~Â£1000 that would shave some of the time off and I could start the course next year, instead of having to wait until the one after.
            
            I'd been playing around with illustrator during the last year or so looked at how I could start a small DIY surf clothing brand and it looked like I could buy some screen printing gear and just keep a 1-in-1-out sort of inventory of my designs - nice and cheap and something that would keep my brain from melting with the boredom of working in a factory.
            
            The designing and printing was easy but I wanted a pretty customised website to sell through and in keeping with my thrifty business plan I didn't want to hire somebody else to design & build the site. I also didn't want to pay monthly/annual listing fees that a lot of the ecommerce services charge - especially since I had no idea if anybody would actually buy this stuff.
            
            I'm sure you've guessed it by now, but that's when I started looking at learning to code. <br>
            I did some very general searches on youtube and google, such as 'How to build a website' etc. And found a ton of how-to's and resources and from that day I started pouring every minute of my free time in to watching videos, ready books and experimenting on my own, mostly with a mix of PHP and JS. I'd spend 8 hours at work, reading on my lunch breaks and while answering natures calls. I'd then get home and spend between 6 and 8 hours studying before going to sleep.
            
            I was f**cking enjoying. A lot.
            My brain was suddenly engaged 10x more than it ever was learning about nearshore currents or when's the best moment to shout 'cowabunga'.
            
            There was a moment when I'd been hanging out with a friend of mine and she asked how my saving was going for my MSc. I turned to her and said 'I think I'm going to the MSc on pause for a year and see how this coding thing goes' - I'll never forget that moment because as I said it I had this incredible smile on my face and suddenly felt incredibly positive about everything. I knew right at that second that I was never going to do that MSc.
            
            A month or so later I had booked a place at Bitmaker Labs in Toronto (I'm from the UK) and went to the bank for a loan to make up the extra money needed on top of what I'd managed to save.
            
            The rest is history, I continued studying my ass off and still do today, some 3 years since I wrote my first few loops in PHP - I never did the MSc, never sold a teeshirt and never regretted allowing a side project take over my life! :) ``
